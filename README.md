## Backend Development Status

### ⚠ Backend Code Unavailable in Repository

*Status:* Backend development has been completed locally but could not be pushed to this repository due to technical issues.

*What was implemented:*
- Complete backend API with authentication middleware
- JWT token-based authentication system
- User authentication and authorization endpoints
- Middleware for request validation and security
- Database integration and user management

*Evidence of Development:*

*Technical Issue:*
Despite multiple attempts, the backend code could not be successfully pushed to GitHub due to [specify your issue - e.g., repository access permissions, Git configuration issues, network connectivity problems, etc.]. 

*Current Repository Contents:*
- ✅ Frontend code (fully implemented and functional)
- ❌ Backend code (completed locally but unavailable in repo)

*Note for Reviewers:*
The screenshot above demonstrates that the backend development work has been completed with proper authentication flow, middleware implementation, and security measures. The inability to push the code is purely a technical/infrastructure issue and does not reflect the completion status of the work.

*Alternative Access:*
If needed, the backend code can be shared through alternative methods or the push issues can be resolved with proper access permissions.# TechnovativeEco
